# Middleman Project Template: HTML5BP HAML

This is the default page for [HTML5 Boilerplate 4.0](http://html5boilerplate.com/) adapted as a HAML [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with [Susy 1.0](http://susy.oddbird.net/) responsive grids ready to go, content using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) organized with [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), Coffeescript, Sprockets and more.

Using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [RVM](https://rvm.io/) is **highly** recommended.

Edit me at /source/index.html.md and start making something beautiful.

## What to do First?

### Helpers

Take a look at [/helpers/](http://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML/tree/master/helpers). We've added a few methods to help DRY up a HTML5BP site that is built with Middleman. If you don't need it: just remove it and restart Middleman.

### Recommendations

* Update `.rvmrc` to the [gemset](https://rvm.io/gemsets/basics/) of your choosing (or remove it if you do not use [RVM](https://rvm.io/))
* Double check `.gitignore` and make sure it is what you want.
  * eg: `build/` is ignored by default.
* If you don't use `middleman init` to load the template, make sure to [use and run Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).

## Documentation

[Middleman HTML5 Boilerplate HAML documentation](https://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML/tree/master/DOCS.md): A good overview of some of the small changes we made with this version of the HTML5 Boilerplate.

[HTML5 Boilerplate documentation](https://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML/tree/master/html5bp-docs): Documentation that is included with the HTML5 Boilerplate. **Note: Some things (e.g. ways of including, specific javascript and CSS paths) will differ between this version of the HTML5 Boilerplate and the original.**

## Contribute

Have a better way of doing this? **[Jump on in](https://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML)**. If there are better defaults to include in a Middleman workflow, add them in. This is just what [I](http://www.dannyprose.com) use (and [continually update](https://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML)) as my standard default for Middleman Sites.
